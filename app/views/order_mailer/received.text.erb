Dear <%= @order.name %>

Thank you for your order from my awesome store!

You ordered the following items:

<%= render @order.line_items %><!--By default, this render() call will search for _line_item.text.erb-->

We'll send you another email when your order ships.

<%= @greeting %>, find me in app/views/order_mailer/received.text.erb
