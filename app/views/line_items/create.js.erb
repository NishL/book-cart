// Code for AJAX request from the store index page to add item to cart.
// The following code tells the browser to replace the content whose element id is cart with that HTML.
// The jQuery library is aliased to '$', and most usages of jQuery start there.
// 1) The first call - `$('#cart')` - tells jQuery to find the HTML element that has an id of 'cart'.
// 2) The html() method (http://api.jquery.com/html/) is called with a first argument of the desired replacement for the contents of this element.
//    The content is formed by a call to the `render()` method on the @cart object.
// 3) The output of the method is processed by an `escape_javascript()` helper method, using an alias named `j()`, that converts this Ruby
//    string into a format acceptable as input to JavaScript.
// NOTE: This script is executed in the browser. The only parts executed on the server are the parts within the `<%= %>` delimiters.

$('#cart').html("<%=j render(@cart) %>");

$('#current_item').css({'background-color':'#88ff88'}).animate({'background-color':'#114411'}, 6000);
